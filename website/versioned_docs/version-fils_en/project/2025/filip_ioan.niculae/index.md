## Description

This project presents a small-scale smart irrigation system capable of automating or manually controlling water delivery to a cultivated area. Managed through a Windows desktop GUI developed using ImGui and DirectX 11, the system communicates via UART to display real-time environmental and system data. 

Users can switch between AUTO mode, where irrigation is triggered automatically based on soil humidity, and MANUAL mode, which allows full control over the water pump and specific water quantities to be dispensed.

Additional features include the ability to monitor parameters such as external temperature, atmospheric pressure, water tank temperature, and current water volume. The system also supports tank configuration, enabling users to input its shape and dimensions so that accurate calculations can be made based on sensor readings. This project demonstrates how digital interfaces and real-time sensor integration can support precision irrigation, even at a reduced scale.

## Motivation

I’ve always been fascinated by how technology can make life easier, and agriculture is a perfect area to apply that. This project allows me to combine my passion for tech with my interest in sustainable practices. I wanted to create a system that can help people automate the irrigation process and make it more efficient, especially for small-scale or hobbyist growers.

## Architecture

The following diagram presents an overview of the physical interconnections in the system:

### Passive Buzzer

- **Interface**: PWM / GPIO  
- **Role**: Beeps for alerts (dry soil, low water, etc.)

---

### UART Communication

- **Interface**: UART over USB  
- **Role**: Sends data to and receives commands from ImGui desktop app

---

### Level Translator

- **Role**: Converts 3.3V GPIO signals from NUCLEO to 5V for relay module compatibility  
- **Connection**: Between NUCLEO GPIO pins and Relay IN pins  
- **Power Source**: 5V external power

---

### 5V Power Source

- **Role**: Powers the following modules:
  - Relay module  
  - Mini Submersible Water Pump  
- **Important**: This power source is separate from the USB powering the NUCLEO board

## Log

<!-- write every week your progress here -->

### Week 6 - 12 May
This week, I focused on getting all the hardware parts set up. I put together and wired up the NUCLEO board, all the sensors (BME280, HC-SR04, Soil Moisture, NTC), the relay module, and the water pumps, making sure the level translators and the 5V power supply were hooked up correctly. Once all the physical parts were connected and I double-checked everything, I drew up the circuit diagram for the system in KiCad to map out how all the components talk to each other.

### Week 7 - 19 May
The primary focus shifted to software, starting with the Windows desktop GUI. I set up the ImGui and DirectX 11 environment and designed the basic UI layout for sensor data display and user controls. Concurrently, I began implementing the UART communication protocol on both the NUCLEO firmware and the desktop application to establish an initial data link. Basic sensor reading stubs were also added to the firmware.
