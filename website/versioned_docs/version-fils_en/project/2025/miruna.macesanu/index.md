## Description  
This project is a **portable lie detector** that analyzes **heart rate variability (HRV)** to detect signs of stress or deception. It uses a **pulse sensor** to capture heart rate signals, processes the data using a **Raspberry Pi Pico 2** running Rust, and displays the result in real time.  

The device provides feedback in three ways:  
- Displays the result on an **LCD screen**  
- Lights up an LED:  
  - ðŸŸ¥ **Red** = Lie  
  - ðŸŸ¨ **Yellow** = Unsure  
  - ðŸŸ© **Green** = Truth  
- Sends session data over **USB serial** for logging or analysis  

A **push button** starts each detection session manually, making the device interactive and easy to use.

## Motivation  
I chose this project because Iâ€™ve always been interested in how technology can interpret signals from the human body. The idea of detecting stress or deception by analyzing heart rate variability felt like a meaningful challenge that connects both **biology** and **technology** â€” two areas I find fascinating.  

At the same time, this project gave me the opportunity to deepen my skills in **embedded Rust programming**, work with **real-time signal processing**, and design an interactive system that gives immediate feedback. Itâ€™s rewarding to build something that not only works technically but also helps visualize how small changes in the body can reflect emotional states. I see this as a step toward future projects where technology can be used to better understand or respond to human behavior.

## Architecture

### Schematic Diagram
![Architecture Diagram](diagram.webp)

### Main Architecture Components  
- **Sensor Interface Layer**  
  Captures analog signals from the pulse sensor via the Picoâ€™s ADC.  

- **Signal Processing & Detection Logic**  
  - Filters and processes the heart rate signal.  
  - Uses algorithms (e.g., HRV analysis) to detect stress or deception.  
  - Decides the result: "Lie", "Unsure", or "Truth".  

- **User Interface Layer**  
  - Displays the detection result on the OLED screen.  
  - Controls the LEDs to give visual feedback (Red, Yellow, Green).  
  - Monitors the push button to start sessions.  

- **Communication Layer**  
  Sends processed data and session results over USB serial using `usbd-serial`.

### Connections Between Components  
- **Sensor Interface Layer â†’ Signal Processing & Detection Logic**  
  (Heart rate data is read and processed.)  

- **Signal Processing & Detection Logic â†’ User Interface Layer**  
  (Detection result is displayed on OLED and indicated with LEDs.)  

- **Signal Processing & Detection Logic â†’ Communication Layer**  
  (Session data is transmitted over USB serial.)  

- **User Input (Start Button) â†’ Signal Processing & Detection Logic**  
  (Triggers the start of a new detection session.)

## Log

### Week 5 - 11 May
I  bought the necessary components and started assembling them on the breadboard, except for the LCD screen, which still needs the pins soldered in the next lab session. I also configured a Raspberry Pi Pico 2W to be used as a debugger. I tested with a simple code to check if the LEDs,the pulse sensor and the button work correctly and are connected properly.

### Week 12 - 18 May
Connected all hardware components and started initial code development


### Week 19 - 25 May
I placed all the hardware components in a box so that it looks like a project and it's perfectly clear what it does without me having to explain. I also finished implementing the code with the logic to convert the data received from the pulse sensor into beats per minute.

## Hardware

The device is built around the Raspberry Pi Pico 2W microcontroller, which serves as the brain of the system. It reads physiological signals from a Pulse Sensor XD-58C for heart rate monitoring. The detection results are shown in real-time on an LCD ecru display and indicated visually through three LEDs (Red for lie, Yellow for unsure, Green for truth).

A tactile push button allows the user to manually start each detection session. All components are connected using a breadboard, jumper wires, and pin headers for prototyping. Basic electronic components like resistors are used for signal conditioning and LED current limiting.
