## Description

This project involves the development of a digital alarm clock, designed to improve the morning waking experience. The clock functions like a regular one, but it stands out by how the alarm is turned off: the sound gradually increases in volume until it reaches a maximum level, and to stop it, the user must input the correct answer to a math problem displayed on the screen.

## Motivation

Many students struggle to wake up in the morning, especially during exam periods or important lectures. Regular alarms can be ignored or turned off easily, either because they are not loud enough or because they can be disabled with a single button press.

The Xtreme Math Alarm Clock is an innovative solution that introduces an intellectual challenge to the waking process: to stop the alarm, the user must solve a math problem shown on the screen. The volume increases progressively, promoting active waking, and the required interaction reduces the chances of falling back asleep. This project successfully combines embedded hardware with cognitive stimulation in a useful and creative way.

## Architecture

**Raspberry Pi Pico 2W**: Serves as the central unit, managing all logic and timekeeping operations of the system, including interfacing with other components.

**DS3231 RTC Module**: Maintains accurate time, even without power, enabling precise alarm scheduling.

**OLED Display (SSD1306)**: Displays the current time and the math problem required to stop the alarm.

**4x4 Matrix Keypad**: Allows the user to input their answer to the displayed math problem. Each key press is read by the Pico for validation.

**Passive Buzzer**: Emits the alarm sound, with intensity controlled via PWM by the Pico.

**Digital Potentiometer MCP41010**: Programmatically adjusts the buzzer’s volume, increasing the intensity over time.

**MicroSD Module**: Enables storing data such as last wake-up times, settings, or usage logs.

All components are controlled and synchronized by the Raspberry Pi Pico 2W, which acts as the system's brain. The RTC provides timekeeping, and when the alarm time is reached, the Pico activates the buzzer and displays a math question. The user must input the correct answer through the keypad. In the meantime, the sound level is progressively increased using the digital potentiometer.
