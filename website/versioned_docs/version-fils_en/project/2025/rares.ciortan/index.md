## Description
Pocket Poker is a single-player Texas Hold'em-style poker game that runs entirely on a Raspberry Pi Pico 2W, using a 1.8" SPI TFT LCD for the displays and push buttons for input. The game allows the player to go head-to-head against a simple AI dealer, simulating betting rounds, card dealing, and hand evaluation. All logic and graphics are written in Rust, demonstrating how embedded systems can be used for interactive, game-like applications without requiring internet or external screens.

## Motivation
I wanted to create something more interactive and fun than traditional embedded projects. Poker is a great balance of logic, randomness, and user interface work. This project is a chance to explore Rust for embedded systems, work with SPI-based LCDs, and implement game logic on limited hardware.

## Architecture
![Architecture Diagram](Poker.webp)

**Raspberry Pi Pico 2W**: Acts as the main controller. Runs the game logic written in Rust. Communicates with the displays via SPI and handles button input through GPIO.
-**Connection**: Communicates with the display via SPI and handles button input through GPIO.

**Buttons**: Used for player inputs (Check,Bet,Fold).
-**Connection**: Each button is connected to a GPIO pin with pull-down resistors for clean signals.
**Displays**: Used to show the table cards, your cards, balance of both players/game state.
-**Connection**: Connected via SPI (MOSI and CLK), plus control pins (CS, DC, RST).

## Log
### Week 5-11 May
In this week I mostly made the documentation, containing the description, motivation, architecture showing how it would work more or less, the start of the hardware section, bill of materials, list of software i might use, and some links to websites.
### Week 12-18 May
This week I finished building the hardware, bought a few more items I needed and updated the documentation with the kicad schematic, a photo of the hardware built and added the hardware i bought to the bill of materials. I tested to see if the displays were connected properly and they were fine.
### Week 19-25 May

## Hardware
The hardware consists of a raspberry pi pico 2W microcontroller as the core unit, around 3 displays used for displaying the cards, balance etc. , buttons for checking, folding, betting.
