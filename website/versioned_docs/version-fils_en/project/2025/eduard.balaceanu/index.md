## Description

This project showcases the knowledge acquired throughout the semester by designing a functional hardware system that runs software written entirely in Rust. The system replicates a simplified version of the adaptive headlight functionality found in modern vehicles, using a matrix of LEDs controlled by a Raspberry Pi Pico 2W microcontroller.

The setup includes multiple white LEDs arranged in a grid, which dynamically turn on/off or dim based on real-time sensor input. The system uses light sensors to detect the presence and direction of oncoming lights, and a distance sensor to identify nearby objects. It also features adaptive cornering simulation using a joystick input.

The goal is to demonstrate real-time hardware control, sensor input interpretation, and modular embedded design using the Rust programming language.


## Motivation

One of my biggest passions is cars—and everything they represent. I've always loved the feeling of a late-night drive, but to truly enjoy it, you need a powerful and intelligent lighting system. Matrix LED headlights represent the pinnacle of automotive lighting technology, adapting dynamically to changing road conditions, light sources, and traffic.

I’ve been fascinated by how this system works, how it improves both safety and comfort, and why it isn’t more widely adopted across all types of vehicles. Through this project, I wanted to explore the core principles behind adaptive lighting and bring a simplified version to life using accessible components and Rust-based control logic.



## Architecture

The system architecture consists of the following functional layers:

1. **Sensor Layer**  
   - Three ambient light sensors (TEMT6000) detect the direction and intensity of incoming light sources.
   - One ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04) measures the distance to nearby objects.

2. **Input Layer**  
   - A joystick is used to simulate vehicle steering input for adaptive cornering.

3. **Control Layer**  
   - A Raspberry Pi Pico 2W reads input data from all sensors.
   - A custom control algorithm written in Rust determines which LEDs should be turned on, off, or dimmed.

4. **Output Layer**  
   - A matrix of white LEDs is powered and controlled via IRLZ44N MOSFETs.
   - The system dims or disables individual LEDs based on sensor input to avoid blinding oncoming traffic while preserving road visibility.

5. **Feedback Layer (Planned)**  
   - A small OLED display will be used to show real-time system feedback such as active LEDs, steering direction, and sensor status.

Each component is connected using breadboards and jumper wires, with careful power and grounding design to ensure stability. The entire system operates without external Wi-Fi or cloud dependency, functioning in a fully local, embedded environment.

## Weekly Log

### Week 8 – May 4th

Over the past few weeks, I’ve been gathering all the necessary components for the project. After pitching my idea to the professor and getting the green light, I decided to attempt building a simplified version of the Matrix LED adaptive headlight system used in modern vehicles.

This week marked the official start of the documentation process. I’ve already experimented with wiring the Pico 2W, tested the debugger, and ran a few simple LED blink tests in Rust to confirm everything’s working. Most of the hardware is now in place — the MOSFETs, LEDs, sensors, and breadboards — though I’m still waiting on the OLED screen and joystick module.

I also started working on the architecture diagram using diagrams.net. I’m aiming to create something clean and professional, so the structure makes sense both visually and logically. Once that’s done, I’ll export it and integrate it into the site. Documentation is coming together nicely so far.


## Hardware Design

The core of the system is built around a Raspberry Pi Pico 2W, which interfaces with a 6×3 matrix of white LEDs. These LEDs are arranged in 6 columns and 3 rows and are controlled through IRLZ44N N-channel MOSFETs. Each column has a dedicated MOSFET that connects the cathodes of the LEDs in that column to ground, while the rows are powered individually using GPIO pins through 330Ω resistors. This allows matrix-style multiplexing, which significantly reduces the number of GPIOs required to control multiple LEDs individually.

The full assembly is split across two breadboards:

One holds the Pico microcontroller, all necessary resistors, and distributes row power rails

The second contains all MOSFETs, the LEDs, and the column control wiring

In addition to the LED control, the hardware integrates multiple sensors:

Two TEMT6000 light sensors, used to detect ambient brightness from both sides

One HC-SR04 ultrasonic distance sensor, used to measure object proximity

(Planned) A joystick for manual steering simulation

All sensors are powered by the Pico and are connected to its GPIOs as shown below.

Sensor Wiring (More Detailed Explanation)
TEMT6000 Ambient Light Sensors (x2)
The project uses two TEMT6000 ambient light sensors, placed on opposite sides of the breadboard to detect directional brightness — simulating oncoming traffic from the left or right. These sensors output an analog voltage that varies with light intensity, allowing the Pico to react accordingly.

Each sensor has three pins:

S (Supply): Connected directly to the Pico’s 3.3V output pin

G (Ground): Connected to the common GND rail shared across the circuit

V (Analog output): Connected to an ADC-capable GPIO on the Pico 

HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Distance Sensor
The HC-SR04 module is used to detect obstacles in front of the LED array, simulating real-time responsiveness to nearby objects or vehicles. It has four pins:

VCC: Connected to 5V (VSYS) from the Pico

GND: Connected to the common ground rail

TRIG: Connected to GP2, configured as an output

ECHO: Connected to GP3, configured as an input, with a voltage divider

The ECHO pin outputs 5V, which is unsafe for direct connection to the Pico’s 3.3V GPIOs. To protect the microcontroller, a simple resistive voltage divider is used:

A 1kΩ resistor connects ECHO to GP3

A 2kΩ resistor connects the midpoint between ECHO and GP3 to GND

This reduces the 5V ECHO pulse to ~3.3V, making it safe for the RP2040 input.
